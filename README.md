MasterMind style game with numbers for Android

MasterMind was a board game designed in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz. 
Since then it had been a beloved brain exercise game until game consoles had arrived.

MasterMind with Numbers for Android is a variation of this classic board game which replaces the colors with numbers 0-9.

The game starts as you and computer choose a 4-digit number where all digits are unique. Then the computer tries to guess your number. 
At the same time you try to guess computer's number. After each guess two hints are giving back. 
White hint is for the correct number total and correct index of the digit (positive points).
Red hint is for the correct number total but wrong index of the digit (negative points).
For example let the number be 6590 and you guessed 9504

The number 5 is exist and in the right index. So the white hint point is 1
The numbers 9 and 0 also exist but the index is wrong. So the red hint point is -2 

In 15 rounds the one who guesses the opponent's number correctly wins. 
If no one can guess in 15 rounds it's a draw. 

<b>The main goal is to code a computer guess logic where it's hard to beat.</b>

The current computer logic is not doing well. Needs to be upgraded.

The code is free to use and open to develop.
